Translation Modeling 



General purpose is to model translational control of gene expression in the
NCI60 panel that profile gene expression at mRNA and protein levels.
Translational control is expected to uncouple mRNA from protein levels.

R scripts
-------------

R-script: nci60data.R 
aim: save the initial data from NCI60 and basic Ensembl annotation 
     in to an R session
out: ../data/data.rda
notes: you can't run this script because original files are too big for GitHub

R-script: annotation.R
aim: get genomic ccordinates for genes profiled at
     either level in the NCI60 panel
out: ../data/annotation.rda


R-script: summerizedExperiment.R
aim: define SummarizedExperiment-class object for NCI60 processed data.
     Metadata are RNA/protein gene expression values in log10 scale.
     If a gene is not profiled at a level, it gets NA values at that level
out: ../data/NCI60.summarizedExperiment.rda


R-scrpt: cisBP-RNA.R
aim: R objects containing RBPs per motifs (PWMs) and vice versa
     from the CISBP-RNA database (version 0.6)
out: ../data/CISBP-RNA.rda


R-script: nci60.rbpTarget.meme.R
aim: report RBP-target interactions as 1 (>=1 binding site in
     either 5' or 3'UTR of the gene) or 0 (otherwise). The input file 
     contains RBP binding sites with FIMO-returned q-value < .20
out: ../data/rbp.target.binary.txt
note: you can't run thsi script as it uses a file too big for GitHub.

R-script: nci60rbp.R
aim: 
 - plot n. targets per RBP and vice versa 
 - distribution of average/SD of RBP protein/mRNA log(Intensity,10) 
   on available lines
out: ../results/nci60rbp.pdf


R-script: nci60target.R
aim: distribution of average/SD of protein/mRNA log(Intensity,10) for RBP target
out: nci60target.pdf


R-script: rcv.R
aim: compare extra-samples prediction error by
     repeated (R=10) K-fold (K=5) cross-validation (RCV).
out: ../results/rcv.summary.txt


R-script: rcv.ridge.R
aim: compare extra-samples prediction error by
     repeated (R=10) K-fold (K=5) cross-validation (RCV).
     Here M1 linear models are fitted with elastic-net regularization (alpha=0).
     We use the cv.glmnet() function in glmnet (nfolds=3).
out: ../results/rcv.summary.txt



R-script: fit_functions.R
aim: functions used to generate and assess models of translation control
     in the mRNA/protein NCI60 dataset
out: N/A 



R-script: rcv.out.plot.R
aim: plot histograms of relative prediction error perfoirmances
out: ../results/rcv.out.pdf


R-script: rcv.out.plot.ridge.R
aim: plot histograms of relative prediction error performances and
 histograms of parameters related to the cross-validation for tuneling 
 M1 model coefficients.
out: ../results/rcv.out.ridge.penalty.pdf


R-script: model.diagnostic.R
aim: randomly sampled diagnostic plots of models fittedon full NCI60 data set
out: ../results/model.diagnostic.pdf
